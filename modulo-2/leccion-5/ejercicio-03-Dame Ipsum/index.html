			You’re going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot? You act like you want
			me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage. You shouldn't like
			things because people tell you you're supposed to. Mistakes have been made.
			Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's. Friends don't lie.
			So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Bitchin' Why are you keeping this curiosity
			door lock? Um, I'm happy you're home. You’re going to take out the demigorgon
			with a slingshot? I need my paddles! You’re going to take out the demigorgon
